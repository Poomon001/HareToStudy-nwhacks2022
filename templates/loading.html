            Stress: a word all of us students can relate to.
            Due to the pandemic, students spend more than half their day sitting at their computers,
            which are affecting their physical and mental health. Working from home has also increased burnout rate and
            making it more and more difficult to stay focused and productive throughout the day.

            To help students with their mental and physical health, our team created the web app “Hare”.
            “Hare” seeks to combat anxiety and stress by assisting students through
            its many features: the app generates periods of studying and rest to guide the user with time management;
            it also provides important information on what stretches to perform to keep your body feeling good and
            has mini-games to help them relax and calm their anxious nerves. Through “Hare” our team hopes
            to help students around the world manage their time and stress.
